Imagine that you have no experience in the area and need to know more about how to develop a blog? That's what happened at the first NERV Open Source event, the Mercury Project.

Initially we decided to take a test and not even the "instructor" would know how to proceed, so, everyone would learn together, if they had problems, they would find together, if they had ideas, doubts or any other index, they would all share together.

And this is what happened. Based on the article by Thiago Marinho from Rocketseat on how to create a blog using NextJS and MongoDB we went deep into the first edition of the event.

The amazing thing is that everyone learned that you don't need more than two lines of code to have your own blog directly on your computer and the rest is up to editing and maintaining the system. All in a few minutes.

We found out that the use of MongoDB was not about saving publications, but just to store the views related to that publication, one of the things we did not choose to put on our NERV blog, which was entirely developed thanks to the event.

Participating members received a "N.E. #1 Mercury" on Discord and they have a room just for them and they may be giving their opinion on the theme of the next edition.
